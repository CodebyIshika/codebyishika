## Hello world !
[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Fira+Code&pause=1000&random=false&width=435&lines=I'm+a+Software+Developer+Student)](https://git.io/typing-svg)
 
 I'm Ishika, a passionate student, who just embarked on a thrilling adventure of software development at Manitoba Institute of Trade and technology.
 
 As I take my first steps into the world of coding, I'm eager to discover the magic of turning ideas into reality through lines of code.
 My journey is just beginning, and I'm excited to learn, experiment, and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts.From creating user-friendly 
 interfaces to solving interesting puzzles, I'm ready to explore it all and build cool stuff.

 Great things happen when we learn and grow together. Connect with me, and let's write our coding story. 
 Together, we can achieve more than we ever imagined.

 
 ### About me

 Outside of coding, I'm a creative soul who finds inspiration in the beauty of nature, the rhythms of music, and the strokes of a pencil. Drawing is my 
 way of bringing imagination to life, while music is the soundtrack to my creative journey.When I'm not lost in the world of art and tunes, you'll 
 often find me exploring the great outdoors, finding serenity in the embrace of nature.
